These scripts were written by Jiseng So. They are provided for use in however you see fit, but also come as-is. I take no responsibility for any damage you may cause them or from them. It's good practice to take a look at what you're running before you run them anyhow!

I've got a YouTube page!

Good luck trying to use my scripts... I can't say I've made them very user-friendly. If there's demand for that sort of thing, I might do that.



Debug.py
	Just displays debug messages.

dfhack/impregnate.lua
    Makes non-egg-layers pregnant. Requires dfhack.
	
network/ipSwitcher.py
	Outputs commands to change IP addresses within specified ranges periodically. Can result in a chaotic network if deployed en masse. Requires 'ifconfig' and 'route'.

network/vpnRandomizer.py
	Randomizes the selected VPN connection. Takes a list of files "selectionList.txt" and makes a symlink to one of those files in "selectedVPN.conf". Meant to be used with an autostarting OpenVPN service.

videos/bmpHandler.py
	Decodes and encodes BMPs. Only handles 24-bit without colorspace information. Used by stringMaker

videos/capImage.py
	Takes screenshots with PIL approximately every second. Also can use the Windows API, but this method is very slow. Saves in PNG.

videos/cheeseImgDater.py
	Incomplete script that's supposed to place text over my cheese images, dependent on the date in the EXIF data.

videos/cheeseSummary.py
	Aggregates my cheese charts and creates a statistical overview.

videos/composite.sh
	Uses ImageMagick to paste the logo and song names into the main images.

videos/Joiner.py
	Takes all .wav files in filename order in the current directory, except the one with the output name, and combines them if possible.

videos/mp3Extract.py
	Extracts MP3's based on the magic number. It's very naive and may make files larger than they should be.

videos/pdfToPng.py
	Converts PDFs to series of PNG images. Outputs very large PNGs with two pages per image.
	
videos/randImgMapper.py
	Makes symlinks random images in a specified directory for a specified number of frames.

videos/SilenceInserter.py
	Applies symlinks linking a moment of silence in ascending numerical order. This is meant to put silence between every track. Used in conjunction with Joiner.py

videos/stringMaker.py
	Takes fontmap.bmp, a list of the characters contained within the font map from left to right, top to bottom, and a list of phrases, outputting them to one large image, ready to be copasted somewhere else.

videos/stringWordsToImages.py
	Converts each word in a sentence into its own image. Words can be grouped together with the underscore.

videos/Targets.py
	Uses timing arrays to lay out frames with symlinks. Used in conjunction with the mf feature of MEncoder.

videos/TargetsAdvanced.py
	Can lay out frames with specified directories. More complex and flexible than Targets.py.

videos/timeIndexToList.py
	Converts time indexes into timing arrays to be used in Targets.py.
	
videos/WavIndexer.py
	Takes all wavs in filename order and puts out a time index and timing array.

wiki/WikiCalendar.py
    Makes a wikitext calendar with a given year and month.

2018-09-16
    Create WikiCalendar.py.

2018-08-03
    Add impregnate.lua
    Pushed to Github.

2018-01-17

2017-12-17
	Created vpnRandomizer.py.

2017-08-05
	stringMaker.py now outputs separate files for each phrase.
	bmpHandler.py now refuses to write empty files.
